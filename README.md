# Python Security Projects

A collection of security tools and utilities built while learning Python and cybersecurity fundamentals. Each project demonstrates different programming concepts applied to real-world security problems.

## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey learning Python through the lens of cybersecurity. Each project focuses on practical security applications while building programming skills progressively.

## Projects

### 1. [Password Strength Checker](./01-password-strength-checker)
A tool that analyzes password strength based on length, character variety, and complexity.

- **Skills Demonstrated:** String manipulation, conditional logic, user input validation, for loops
- **Security Concepts:** Password policies, strength metrics, user feedback
- **Status:**  Complete

### 2. [Advanced Password Strength Checker](./02-advanced-password-checker)
A comprehensive password analyzer with 6 security checks and smart scoring system.

- **Skills Demonstrated:** While/for loops, string processing, pattern detection, user interaction, break/continue
- **Security Concepts:** Password policies, weak pattern detection, sequential analysis, multi-criteria scoring
- **Status:**  Complete

*More projects coming soon as I progress through the curriculum...*

## Learning Objectives

Each project builds on previous concepts while introducing new ones:

- **Unit 1:** Variables, strings, conditionals, basic loops
- **Unit 2:** Advanced loops, functions, error handling
- **Unit 3:** File I/O, log parsing, data structures
- **Unit 4:** Network programming, API integration
- **Unit 5:** Machine learning basics for anomaly detection

## Skills Being Developed

**Python Programming:**
- Core syntax and data structures
- Functions and modular code
- File I/O and data parsing
- Error handling and debugging
- Working with external libraries

**Cybersecurity Concepts:**
- Password security and authentication

- Network security fundamentals
- Threat detection and response
- Security tool development

## Goals

- Build a portfolio of functional security tools
- Develop proficiency in Python programming
- Understand core cybersecurity principles
- Prepare for Security+ certification
- Transition into a cybersecurity career
